Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet.

208,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product.

Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",problem discovery

336,I dislike the latest version My notes randomly disappear They are listed under the wrong name (usually by the one that is actually above it) I LOVED the version prior to this one This version is making me lose my confidence that my notes are actually being saved!,problem discovery
337,"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

Only suggestion add ability to copy note links",problem discovery
338,"I really wanted a note system I could trust, but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade",problem discovery
339,It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow,problem discovery
340,"Okay Evernote, I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentation, etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know, but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want  need a proper Evernote!",problem discovery

342,"Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes
Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not!",problem discovery

344,No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo,problem discovery
345,"Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But, really! The notes, bullet points, spacing, numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message 

All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version, it doesn't In fact, if this version were more solid, I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade",problem discovery
346,"When this app worked, I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 (after I tried reinstalling and rebooting) is to log in using user name instead of email (or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other) But annoying this happens at all 

If it works for you, this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place",problem discovery
347,"Today's update, dated March 1, 2013 is horrible!  Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times! I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!  I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents  If this bug isn't fixed pronto, I will have to delete Evernote permanently, and use a different App!  ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!",problem discovery

350,"Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version",problem discovery

The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system, it does not support controller or keyboard input. The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port.

577,Pretty Good!	I give it three stars because there's alot of photo editing apps that already have the same features for free.... you'll get that fifth star whenever the clone effect is added....but it's pretty good but no better than the FREE apps with these same effects..,rating

580,"Good stuff	This app would be better if the draw function had the same beautiful brushes as Line Brush.

613,"The best -- one suggestion	I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves -- not just an option for high-contrast greyscale. That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic. 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit.   I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option.   Great job on all the rest though.",rating

One is for my pictures so that when I take a picture, it will instantly be sync'ed to my google cloud account, and then my PC syncs with google cloud, meaning I should never lose a picture.   I also do an occasional sync to my NAS drive as I'm a bit paranoid.  I also sync from my MP3 folder on my NAS account back onto my phone card, so that when I add some new music to my NAS drive, it will sync onto my phone.  Altogether a very useful program.",rating

829,"You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab. Has saved me so much in time.",rating

837,"The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities, it's pretty much useless. Even if you do live in a big city, the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller, which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup.",rating
838,"I bought this app on December 24th. I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set. I had issued where the terrain map would not load, and was blacked out. All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!",rating
839,"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. 

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. 

I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.",rating
840,"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!",rating
841,"Pretty easy to use - been using it for over 2 years.  Easy to learn.  As new features were added, those features made sense!",rating
842,"This is, hands down, the most useful app. I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade. It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar. I love it!!",rating
843,Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down. Needs dedicated space for mileage.,rating
844,Love it's multifunctionality. Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc!,rating

846,Works awesome for me. Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles. Scan works a lot but type and search fills in. Really live off this app. love the drink now feature. Use that every week!,rating
847,Better than any other wine app.,rating
848,It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate.,rating
849,"This app is beast! The best thing is, is that it doesn't need Internet! Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public. I recomend  this app!",rating

861,"To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app...you CAN! Let me help. Simply tap on the chart or image itself.

868,I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!,rating
869,A must buy.,rating
870,"For the price, it's great. I've been using quicken for 5 years now, but I've switched to this app 2 years ago. My wife and I use the sync option and are now keeping a budge very easily. Awesome app- needs a desktop version!",rating

876,Great for daily readings. I love it.,rating
877,This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!,rating
878,Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.,rating
879,What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.,rating
880,Doodle jump is sick. I love it! He's so freaking cute!,rating
881,"I needed a good flash card system for my Mandarin vocabulary, and this is everything I could have asked for.  If never heard of Quizlet before, but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin, and my Simplified Chinese keyboard, I was easily able to make a custom list of words.  ? (shu?) on one side, and ""water"" on the other for instance.  Inputting them to this app was super easy!  Very well done and totally worth the $4.  Quizlet is free, by the way.",rating
882,"Pixel for pixel, this scanner does better than an expensive HP printer/scanner. Part of that is the iPhone but the other part is JotNot's software. I use this in my presentations for text off a page. (it doesn't do so well with images though, hence the 4 stars.) taken as a whole, it's money well spent.",rating
883,Fantastic app ! Makes reading forums so much easier that now I find myself doing it more. Great!!,rating

909,I love dis right Herre,rating
910,"I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it.  If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",rating
911,I love it,rating
912,"Got this app to be able to share PPT and Word docs. Does not support all of the data from those files. Not happy with it at all. Will try to work with it, but I think it was a waste of time and money!",rating

916,VERY WELL,rating
917,Great app. Works on almost any course. No complaints at all.,rating
918,"Overall fantastic.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.

Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.

Statistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. 

Needs a better social aspect.",rating
919,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",rating
920,"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",rating
921,This app while not perfect (some songs it doesn't) is very good. I use it severalvtimes a week.,rating

Update to a month and a half later.
I love this navigation devise have used it more than my factory one I can listen to my music while navigating and it's points of interests rock ! The turn by turn speech and real time traffic is long gone but I don't miss it at all ! If I could give this app more stars I would",rating
937,"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.",rating
938,"The best news, I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story!",rating
939,Smooth simple app,rating

944,That says it all.,rating
945,Love this app! Easy way to keep track of what's in my closet and mix and match pieces. Even better when I got an iPhone so I could take pictures of my clothes and load directly to the app. Perfect for any Fashionista!,rating

As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!",rating
952,I find that this app does exactly what I wanted it to do- display meaningful data from all the iPhone sensors. Very clear and intuitive interface. It's really the only tool of it's type I need.,rating
953,Very nice-looking app!,rating
954,"My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless ""hole-in-time"" this thing hides. If you are not very careful, you will fall into this hole (which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else) and your family or friends may lose you. Leave a note and tell them where you went, and don't worry, you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole! Finally, I wrote/chatted with the guy who wrote this - good man and thanks for this jewel!",rating
955,Best app in the entire world,rating

Only bug I've seen is Facebook integration at times.",rating
988,"I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs.

1017,I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.

1042,I like the new features that make the product more Stanza-like. I still would like to be able to go directly from the library list to the current place in any given book without having to pass by the TOC page.,rating
1043,Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order. Easy to use!,rating
1044,"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. 

There is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.",rating

1115,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",rating
1116,"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!",rating
1117,"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!!

1146,"Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do. Radar is slow to load, but I have another app for that. There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",rating

1165,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great.

A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more.

I really hope you guys upgrade and soon because it's making it pointless for me to be on the site...",rating
1369,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",rating
1370,I find this app very useful. It has mechanism and class info that most of the other free programs are missing. You can't do much better (esp for free)!,rating
1371,Great,rating
1372,This app is awesome!,rating
1373,It works perfect for me.,rating

1395,At 47 my eyes are not that good. This really works very well.,rating
1396,Great and useful app. I have nothing bad at all to say about it. It helps me find the best deals on gas around the city with little to no glitches. Does what it's supposed to. 5 stars!,rating
1397,Always completely up to date.,rating
1398,"I have used this app locally, as well as while traveling.  Sometimes it's off, but for the most part, it works great.",rating

1403,Particularly like the reminder!,rating
1404,Accurate,rating
1405,"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",rating
1406,I absolutely love this app. I scan whatever I see....,rating

1413,Great app,rating
1414,This app is so convenient! I looovvve it!!,rating
1415,Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.,rating
1416,Awesome! The real deal!,rating
1417,Somehow I lost my contacts. This app got everything back for me,rating

1471,I have made many purchases from FAB and have been mostly very satisfied. The offerings are unique and of good quality. But don't expect your stuff in a hurry as many items are handcrafted. One criticism is that there are not multiple views of the items and the descriptions are somewhat lacking.,rating

1541,"This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics, cute characters, and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",rating

Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times!

I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!

2970,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",feature request
2971,"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.",feature request

2973,"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",feature request
2974,"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards.

I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. 

There is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.",feature request
2978,"Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants, but that is literally all you will find. No grocery stores, cafes, or anything that is not fast food or large chains. No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods, and definitely nothing remotely healthy. Also lacking an option for submissions.I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing.",feature request
2979,"99cents can't go wrong. I'd like to have a map feature, but overall it does what it was programmed to do well.",feature request
2980,"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.

Add simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. 

Five star!",feature request

I need it much..",feature request
2982,Great app! Couple suggestions for the next update though. Add a way to see the degree of angles and also it would be great to actually be able to have two videos side by side to compare.,feature request
2983,"Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",feature request
2984,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,feature request
2985,"Ok people...this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work, you shouldn't own a smart phone, especially the iPhone. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts. Looking forward to future updates. ????????",feature request
2986,"It needs a few things like some more cheats and another game mode:Zombies or instead just call it ""walking dead syndrome"" superb app, though",feature request
2987,"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.",feature request
2988,I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount,feature request
2989,this is a pretty good app. great to be free. it is super slow on load time. that needs to be fixed. also change the default time. it's so annoying because sometimes I forget to change it and dont see all my hw. also push notofications would be wonderful! other than that it's great. I'm a sophomore math major taking 20 hours and this app helped me stay on top of things!,feature request
2990,Easy to use. I wished it was able to determine what hole you were on.,feature request
2991,Very nice. Better if map would center on my location automatically when I trim app on.,feature request

3005,Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone.

Tally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment.",feature request

1 Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then#REFRESH!
2 Refresh Button
3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents
4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?
5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker
7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely
8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!",feature request

Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet.

The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.

The battles are not what I'd call real time, more a cross between real and turn based. Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere. The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling. There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often.",user experience

3134,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",user experience
3135,"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",user experience

3213,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",user experience

and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload",user experience

As a teacher, I rely on having access online &amp off line related to research  for work my work as a teacher  Also, I am required to write notes &amp save them as zip files in order to save space

So, please fix Dropbox! Why does it keep telling me that I can't open some documents &amp that I don't have the authorization to alter or edit my document on the flip side, some documents tell me to enter a password (???)

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

3398,"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great 

But the design of this app is terrible  It's jumbled, confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality 

Please redesign the app  Again",user experience

3401,"The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say, I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there, you just have to (gasp) look for a sec

3404,"I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible!

The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember

I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version, not the Evernote across platforms",user experience
